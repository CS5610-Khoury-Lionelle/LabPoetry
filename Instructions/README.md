## :fire: Tasks

### Environment Setup

1. Go into your project directory, and run 
    ```terminal
    npm init -y
    ```
    This will create a package.json for you.
2. Add [vite](https://vite.dev/) by running.
   ```terminal
    npm i --save-dev vite
    ```
    Vite will handle building your project and hosting your website locally.
3. Add [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
   ```terminal
   npm i --save bootstrap @popperjs/core
   ```
   Bootstrap is a front end (html/css/javascript) framework to help
   build responsive websites with common interactive components. 
4. Add Typescript
   ```terminal
   npm i --save typescript
   ```
5. Add sass
   ```terminal
   npm i --save-dev sass
   ```
   sass is an intermediate language that will compile into SCSS (CSS). It allows
   variables, multiple files, and more developer focused features that CSS doesn't have. It is commonly used in bootstrap and other frameworks. 
6. Add gh-pages (for hosting)
   ```terminal
   npm -i --save-dev gh-pages
   ```
   Will allow us to use github pages for hosting. 
7. Add the following folders and files. For adding files, you can either use `touch` or `code` depending on your system. For example, to create an empty main.ts file, you can use `code src/js/main.ts` then save the empty file.
   * Add directories: src, src/js, src/sass
   * Create files: src/js/main.ts, src/sass/styles.scss, vite.config.js

By the end of step seven, your project directory should look like the following.
